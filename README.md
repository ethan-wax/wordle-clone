# Wordle Clone
A clone of the hit internet game. The goal of this project was to get experience using the vue framework.
The word list was taken from the Apple system spellcheck dictionary located at /usr/share/dict/words. As of yet I haven't filtered any words from this list (except for limiting to 5 letter words), so names and places may be fair game.
Like the original, the word picks a new word everyday and remains consistent throughout the day.
